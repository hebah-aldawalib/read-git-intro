# What is a ‘call’?

The MethodCall operator is used to call an arbitrary Java method using the Java reflection API.

# How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

nfinitely. Not really until you don't overflow the stack with function calls. Since each time a function is called all the variables used need space to be store in stack and stack is of limited size so someway in middle of any hundredth or thousandth call you will run out stack for function call.

# What does LIFO mean?

Last in, first out (LIFO) is a method used to account for inventory that records the most recently produced items as sold first.

# Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

# What causes a Stack Overflow?

is excessively deep or infinite recursion, in which a function calls itself so many times that the space needed to store the variables and information associated with each call is more than can fit on the stack.

# What is a ‘refrence error’?

object represents an error when a non-existent variable is referenced.

# What is a ‘syntax error’?

are mistakes in using the language. Examples of syntax errors are missing a comma or a quotation mark, or misspelling a word.

# What is a ‘range error’?

is thrown when trying to pass a value as an argument to a function that does not allow a range that includes the value. This can be encountered when: passing a value that is not one of the allowed string values to String

# What is a ‘tyep error’?

constructor creates a new error when an operation could not be performed, typically (but not exclusively) when a value is not of the expected type.

# What is a breakpoint?

In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code.

At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values.

After examining values, you can resume the execution of code

# What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

Debugging tools (called debuggers) are used to identify coding errors at various development stages. They are used to reproduce the conditions in which error has occurred, then examine the program state at that time and locate the cause.
