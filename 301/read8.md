# What does REST stand for?

In 2000, Roy Fielding proposed Representational State Transfer (REST) as an architectural approach to designing web services. REST is an architectural style for building distributed systems based on hypermedia. REST is independent of any underlying protocol and is not necessarily tied to HTTP.

# REST APIs are designed around a ____.

implementations use HTTP as the application protocol, and this guide focuses on designing REST APIs for HTTP.

# What is an identifer of a resource? Give an example.

A resource has an identifier, which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource. 


# What are the most common HTTP verbs?

 The most common operations are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

# What should the URIs be based on?

 nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource).

# Give an example of a good URI.

# What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?

Another factor is that all web requests impose a load on the web server. The more requests, the bigger the load. Therefore, try to avoid "chatty" web APIs that expose a large number of small resources. Such an API may require a client application to send multiple requests to find all of the data that it requires. Instead, you might want to denormalize the data and combine related information into bigger resources that can be retrieved with a single request. However, you need to balance this approach against the overhead of fetching data that the client doesn't need. Retrieving large objects can increase the latency of a request and incur additional bandwidth costs. .

# What status code does a successful GET request return?

A successful GET method typically returns HTTP status code 200 (OK).

# What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?

If the resource cannot be found, the method should return 404 (Not Found).

# What status code does a successful POST request return?

 if there is no result to return, the method can return HTTP status code 204 (No Content) with no response body.

If the client puts invalid data into the request, the server should return HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request). The response body can contain additional information about the error or a link to a URI that provides more details.

# What status code does a successful DELETE request return?

If the delete operation is successful, the web server should respond with HTTP status code 204 (No Content), indicating that the process has been successfully handled, but that the response body contains no further information. If the resource doesn't exist, the web server can return HTTP 404 (Not Found).
