# nosql vs sql

*five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:*


| SQL                 | Nosql                                  |  
| :-------------      | :----------:                      | 
|databases are relational |databases are non-relational                                   | 
| use structured query language and have a predefined schema|databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data | 
|vertically scalable             | horizontally scalable                                  | 
|table-based                     |document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores                                   | 
|better for multi-row transactions                     |better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.                                  | 


*What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?*

If your data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined 


*Give a real world example.*




*What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?*

On the flip side, data from molecular modeling, Geo-spatial information, and satellite data are highly unstructured.  



*Give a real world example.*

ikewise, data from social media analysis and websites is also highly unstructured, and relationships among the data entities are not clearly defined. In such scenarios, NoSQL is a better choice. For example, a data mining application


*Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?*

 NoSQL


 *Which type of database is best for scalability?*

 SQL


 *What does SQL stand for?*

 Structured Query Language


 *What is a realational database?*

type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another

*What type of structure does a relational database work with?*


A traditional and widely-used data structure is called "B-tree." B-tree structures are a standard part of computer science textbooks and are used in most (if not all) RDBMS products.


*What is a ‘schema’?*

s a cognitive framework or concept that helps organize and interpret information.

*What is a NoSQL database?*

referred to as “not only SQL”, “non-SQL”, is an approach to database design that enables the storage and querying of data outside the traditional structures found in relational databases.

*Howo does it work?*

Over time, four major types of NoSQL databases emerged: document databases, key-value databases, wide-column stores, and graph databases. ... Document databases store data in documents similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. Each document contains pairs of fields and values.

*What is inside of a Mongo database?*

Documents are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. The documents are similar to JavaScript Object Notation, but use a variant called Binary JSON (BSON).

*Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why*


MongoDB is faster than MySQL due to its ability to handle large amounts of unstructured data when it comes to speed.

*What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?*

uses high memory for data storage.
There is a limit for document size, i.e. 16mb.
There is no transaction support in MongoDB.
