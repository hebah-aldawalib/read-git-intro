  **What is JavaScript?**

*JavaScript* is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). 


**The Web Console tool built into Firefox is useful for experimenting with JavaScript; you can use it into two modes: **

-  Single-line input in the Web Console.

-  Multi-line input in the Web Console.
