# Why Forms?

In addition to enabling users to search, forms also allow users to perform other functions online. 
You will see forms when registering as a member of a website, when shopping online, and when signing up for newsletters or mailing lists.

# There are several types of form controls that
you can use to collect information from visitors
to your site:

- ADDING TEXT.
- Making Choiceces.
- Submitting Forms.
- Uploadiding Files.


**HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it
easier for visitors to fill in forms** 



# Listes , Tables and Formes 


- In addition to the CSS roperties which work with the contents of all elements, there are several others that are specifically used to
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.

- List markers can be given different appearances using the list-style-type and list-style image properties.

- Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS
