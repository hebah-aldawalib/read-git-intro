# Layout 


**CSS** has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page:

<ul>
<li>normal flow</li>
<li>relative positioning</li>
<li>absolute positioning</li>

</ul>


- *In normal  flow* : each block-level
element sits on top of the next
one.

- *relative positioning* : You can indicate that an element
should be relatively positioned using the position property
with a value of relative

- *absolute positioning* : When the position property is given a value of absolute,
the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on
the page.
