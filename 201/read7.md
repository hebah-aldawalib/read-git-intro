# What's a Table?

A table represents information in a grid format.
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV
schedules, and sports results.

# Table Structure:

<ol>
<li> < table > element is used
to create a table.</li>
<li> < tr > You indicate the start of each
row using the opening < tr > tag </li>
<li> < td >
Each cell of a table is
represented using a < td >
element.</li>


</ol>



**Note : For long tables you can split the table into a < thead>,
< tbody>, and < tfoot>.**


# WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task.


# WHAT IS AN OBJECT?

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world.





 **JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts**
