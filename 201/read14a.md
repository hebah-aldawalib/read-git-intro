# Transforms

*The transform property* comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.


- **Transform Syntax**

transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.


- **2D Transforms**

Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes.

 - **3D Transforms**

 Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth. 



 # Transitions
 it is to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state.
 
  The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.




  **There are four transition related properties in total**
  
   including transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay.
