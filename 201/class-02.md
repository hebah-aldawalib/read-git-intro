# CSS 
allows you to create rules that specify how the content of 
an element should appear

A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration

CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page


# TEXT
<ul> 
<li>HTML elements are used to describe the structure of 
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).</li>

<li> They also provide semantic information (e.g. where 
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any 
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation)</li>
