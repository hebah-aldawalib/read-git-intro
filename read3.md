**HTML** 


(HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web.

 It defines the meaning and structure of web content.



 HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, and many others.
